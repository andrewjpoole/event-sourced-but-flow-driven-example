# Notes for slides 1-2 problem

Found myself really dis-liking integration tests

Decided to ask myself why?

## local dev ex

functions | app service | service fabric | AKS | IIS on VM and on and on…
There is no one size fits all

Problem getting worse with distributed cloud apps
Especially if you’re org got on the mircroservices bandwagon!

Too many options - VS (IIS, WSL, Docker) Docker (manual vs docker compose?) K8s (Docker Desktop, miniKube, microK8s, Helm? Skaffold?) VSCode, Rider?? Personal preferences

Is it even worth it??

Its necessary to test the integrations between your app and its real dependencies
